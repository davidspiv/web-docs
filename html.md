# HTML

## Overview

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. It consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose sections of content to make it appear or act a certain way.

## Elements

**Element**: defined by opening tag, content, and a
closing tag.

`&lt;element-type&gt;content&lt;/element-type&gt;`

**Void Element**: defined by single tag which is typically used to insert/embed data in document.

`&lt;element-type attribute-property:“value”&gt`
